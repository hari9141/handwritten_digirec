Project Description


This project focuses on generating realistic images of handwritten digits (0–9) using deep learning techniques. By training a neural network on the well-known MNIST dataset, the model learns the patterns and features of handwritten numbers and can then synthesize new digit images that closely resemble human handwriting.
The goal is not classification but generation—that is, creating new images from random inputs. This helps in understanding how deep generative models like autoencoders or generative adversarial networks (GANs) can learn data distributions and create new content.
This project demonstrates the power of neural networks in creative tasks, and serves as a foundation for exploring generative AI in applications like handwriting synthesis, data augmentation, and style transfer.
